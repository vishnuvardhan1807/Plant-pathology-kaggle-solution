"Hello everyone In The file is a solution to kaggle's plant pathology problem any further improvement to increase the models accuracy will be appreciated."

<h4>
    The solution to the following problem involves following steps:
    1. Using the csv files to divide the images Train and validation images
    2. Send all the testing images into into a new directort Test
    3. Then create subfloders in the Train and validation data namely:
       <ol>
            <li>Healthy</li>
            <li>Multiple-dieseases</li>
            </li>Rust</li>
            </li>Scab</li>
       </ol>
    4. Get one with data by viusualizing and understanding the data
    5. Build a pre-trained Efficient-bo model
    6. Fine tune the model by unfreezing the top 3 layers
    7. Find where the model is making most wrong predictions 
    8. Build the final model By shuffling the data
